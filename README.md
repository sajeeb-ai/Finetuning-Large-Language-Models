# Finetuning-Large-Language-Models

## Instructor: Sharon Zhou, Co-Founder and CEO of Lamini, and instructor for the GANs Specialization and How Diffusion Models Work. 

We are able to:

* Understand when to apply finetuning on LLMs
* Prepare our data for finetuning
* Train and evaluate an LLM on our data


With finetuning, weâ€™re able to take our own data to train the model on it, and update the weights of the neural nets in the LLM, changing the model compared to other methods like prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation. Finetuning allows the model to learn style, form, and can update the model with new knowledge to improve results.

Who should join?

Learners who want to understand the techniques and applications of finetuning, with Python familiarity, and an understanding of a deep learning framework such as PyTorch.
